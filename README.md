# plurality

Simple proof of concept wrapper for runC to demonstrate ([http://runc.io/](runC)) can be an alternative to ([http://singularity.lbl.gov/](Singularity)) backed by Docker

## Description

A command line application that is a wrapper for runC to facilitate:
* creation of file system directory based containers based on Docker images
* launching of container in ([https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/rootless-containers-with-runc](rootless ))mode

## Usage

It is just a PoC - so it will blow up on you, but a simple example might be to create and run a container based on a docker image such as:
```
# create a container based on ubuntu:16.04
./plurality create ubuntu:16.04  echo_test
# run something inside the container
./plurality run  echo_test echo "this is a test wahoo"
```

## Install

To install, use `go get`:

```bash
# no sophisticated packaging and dependency resolution here
# install vndr from https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr
$ go get github.com/LK4D4/vndr
$ go get -d github.com/piersharding/plurality
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/piersharding/plurality
# sort out the dependencies
$ vndr
# now build
$ go build .
```

or just simply do:

``

# plurality

Simple proof of concept wrapper for runC to demonstrate ([http://runc.io/](runC)) can be an alternative to ([http://singularity.lbl.gov/](Singularity)) backed by Docker

## Description

A command line application that is a wrapper for runC to facilitate:
* creation of file system directory based containers based on Docker images
* launching of container in ([https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/rootless-containers-with-runc](rootless ))mode

## Usage

It is just a PoC - so it will blow up on you, but a simple example might be to create and run a container based on a docker image such as:
```
# create a container based on ubuntu:16.04
./plurality create ubuntu:16.04  echo_test
# run something inside the container
./plurality run  echo_test echo "this is a test wahoo"
```

The smoke and mirrors part of this PoC is that it uses sudo and tar to unpack the exported images from the Docker image client API.  This is because root is required to create make nodes.

All containers are stored in ${HOME}/.runc .


## Install

To install, use `go get`:

```bash
# no sophisticated packaging and dependency resolution here
# install vndr from https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr
$ go get github.com/LK4D4/vndr
$ go get -d github.com/piersharding/plurality
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/piersharding/plurality
# sort out the dependencies
$ vndr
# now build
$ go build .
```

or just simply do:
```bash
$ make
```


## To Test

After following above "Install" instructions a simple single executable container can be tested with the following:

```bash
# no sophisticated packaging and dependency resolution here
# install vndr from https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr
$ make clean
$ make test
```

You will get output similar to:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /home/piers/.runc/container/echo_test
rm -f plurality example/echo-server
docker rm -f echo_test 2>/dev/null || true
docker rmi echo-server 2>/dev/null || true

```

You should now have an echo server running on port 3333.  This can be tested using netcat with the following:

```bash
$ echo "Hello rootless container!" | nc localhost 3333
Hi, I received your message! It was 26 bytes long and that's what it said: "Hello rootless container!" ! Honestly I have no clue about what to do with your messages, so Bye Bye!
